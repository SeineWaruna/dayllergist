Can wearing a mask help with high PM2.5 exposure?,"Yes, wearing a mask can be effective in reducing inhalation of PM2.5 particles, particularly if it is a high-efficiency filter mask like an N95 or FFP2. These types of masks are designed to filter out very fine particles, thus helping to reduce exposure during high PM2.5 conditions.",gpt_4_turbo,1,0,0
How can I track real-time air quality on Dayllergist?,"Dayllergist provides real-time air quality updates by integrating local pollen and pollution data. Simply check the app's dashboard for current allergen levels in your area.

What outdoor activities should I avoid during poor air quality days?,"Avoid high-exertion activities like running, cycling, or team sports, as increased breathing rates amplify pollutant inhalation. Stay indoors during peak pollution hours (midday/afternoon) and prioritize low-intensity tasks if outdoor exposure is unavoidable.",deepseek_reasoner,2,0,0
How does air pollution worsen allergic asthma?,"Air pollution exacerbates allergic asthma by increasing airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness.  Irritants in pollution trigger mast cell degranulation, releasing inflammatory mediators that constrict airways.",gemini2_5,2,0,0
What should I do if air quality suddenly worsens during the day?,"If air quality deteriorates unexpectedly, stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed to prevent outdoor allergens from entering. Use air purifiers if available, and consider wearing a mask if you must go outside.",gpt_4o_mini,2,0,0
Does rain improve or worsen air quality for allergy sufferers?,"Rain generally improves air quality for allergy sufferers by washing pollen out of the air, thereby reducing the pollen count and providing temporary relief from symptoms. However, after a rainstorm, the subsequent growth of grass, weeds, and mold can eventually lead to an increase in airborne allergens.",gpt_4_turbo,2,0,0
