What is PM2.5 and why is it important for allergies?,PM2.5 refers to tiny particulate matter that can penetrate lungs and worsen respiratory allergies.,"PM2.5 refers to tiny particulate matter in the air that is 2.5 micrometers or smaller in diameter. These particles can come from sources like vehicle emissions, industrial processes, and natural events such as wildfires. Because of their small size, PM2.5 particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, potentially worsening allergy and asthma symptoms. It's important for allergy sufferers to be aware of PM2.5 levels, especially during high pollution days, as these particles can exacerbate respiratory issues. To protect yourself, consider using air purifiers, wearing masks, and staying indoors when air quality is poor. If you have concerns about how PM2.5 affects your health, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional.",2,2,1,7.571428571428571

What is AQI and how should I interpret it for allergies?,AQI (Air Quality Index) measures air pollution levels; lower numbers are better for allergy control.,"AQI stands for Air Quality Index, which measures the level of air pollution. It ranges from 0 to 500, with higher numbers indicating worse air quality. For allergies, here's a quick guide:

- 0-50: Good. Air quality is satisfactory, and allergens are low.
- 51-100: Moderate. Air quality is acceptable, but some allergens may be present.
- 101-150: Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups. People with allergies or asthma might experience symptoms.
- 151-200: Unhealthy. Everyone may begin to experience symptoms, especially those with allergies.
- 201-300: Very Unhealthy. Health alerts are likely, and symptoms can be severe.
- 301-500: Hazardous. Serious health effects can occur, and it's best to stay indoors.

For managing allergies, try to stay indoors when the AQI is high, use air purifiers, and keep windows closed. If you notice your symptoms worsening, it might be a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional. Stay safe!",2,2,1,9.466666666666667
